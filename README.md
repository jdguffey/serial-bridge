Serial Bridge is a tool for making serial ports accessible remotely, both over TCP and via a web interface.

The documentation is hosted [here](https://serial-bridge.readthedocs.io/).

I don't do formal releases, but each push to master is [built automatically](https://github.com/mrozekma/serial-bridge/actions) and the latest is [here](https://github.com/mrozekma/serial-bridge/releases/latest). You can also build from source by cloning this repository and running:

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn package
```
